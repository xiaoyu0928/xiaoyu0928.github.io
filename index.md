# Xiaoyu Chen,PhD (陈晓宇)

<br>

## About Me

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Library and Information Science of the School of Cultural Heritage and Information Management at [Shanghai University](https://apply.shu.edu.cn/), China.

I hold a PhD in Information Studies from [Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/wkwsci) of [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/index).

My research interests focus on ***3U***, namely, user information behavior,user cyberpsychology, and user-generated content, particularly in the context of digital technologies. 

My PhD dissertation studies a particular group of digital influencers who sell self-created knowledge products in an online environment. My dissertation is being jointly supervised by [Dr. Alton Y.K. Chua ](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/index)and [Dr. L.G. Pee](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/peelg/). 

I hold a master’s degree in Information Science of [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), and a bachelor’s degree in Information Management & Information Systems of [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm), both of which are based in [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan), a City of Punk in China.

If you are exploring the possibility of doing research in areas similar to my interests and are keen to become a research-active scholar, feel free to drop me a note. I am most happy to bounce off ideas with you.

Before I went to Singapore to pursue my PhD degree, I had worked at [Xinhua News Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency), Hubei Branch ( July 2016 - December 2016). 

I was born in [Jinzhai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinzhai_County) County, [Anhui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui) Province, P. R. China, also known as "the Cradle of Generals."

**Address:**

# Research

### Research Interests

- **Topics:** Cyberpsychology, Human information behaviour, Social and economic impacts of digital technologies



- **Philosophy:** My research trajectory concentrates largely on "3U"-- user information behavior, user cyberpsychology, and user-generated content. To this end, I attempt to adopt a full-cycle approach to moving my research forward. It begins with a certain "action" that raises my interest (i.e., user information behavior), followed by the "underlying mechanism" (i.e., user cyberpsychology) that allows me to explicate the action behaved by users, and finally looking into the outcome (i.e., user-generated content).



- **Methodologies:** I use mainly quantitative methods including experiments and surveys in my work. On occasion, I have used qualitative methods such as interviews, qualitative content analysis, and qualitative comparative analysis to complement my quantitative research. My skills do not include advanced forms of econometric modeling, simulation, or data mining. However, I am learning the basic knowledge and applications of economic analyses, such as difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity, as I believe that field (quasi-) experiment designs and causal inference will be increasingly popular in information behavior research. Also, I'm interested in design science research that relates to my study areas.
